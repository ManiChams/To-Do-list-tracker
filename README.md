# To-Do List Tracker

https://manichams.github.io/To-Do-list-tracker/

## Description

- To-Do List Tracker is a simple website for storing and reading events using the browser's Local Storage. Instead of having to remember these events (and risk forgetting them in the process), this project allows the user to easily write these events down and check them at a later point in time.


## Usage

- Follow the link to the event wizard from the main page.

- On the event wizard, add the event's name, date, and description.

- Click the "Submit Task" button to save the event to the browser's local storage.
- (Repeat as necessary)
- Click the "Back to Main Page" button to return to the main page.
- On the main page, events are shown in the order they were submitted. Events can be deleted individually or all at once.
